INTRO - an <b>In</b>tertextual <b>R</b>elationships <b>O</b>ntology for literary studies
(work in progress)

## What is INTRO?
INTRO is an ontology for the field of literary studies for representing intertextual relations.
The term ‘intertextual relations is to be understood in the broadest sense. The domain of the ontology includes everything from the identification and characterization of concrete acts of literary (or scholarly) citations or allusions (etc.) to the identification of features that allow to include a text into a larger context (e.g. an epoch, a discourse, an oeuvre ...). INTRO also provides classes and properties necessary to link these findings to their theoretical background or to findings in other research literature, thus covering a large number of scholarly acts.

Here is a <a href="http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BOberreither/INTRO/master/INTRO_BETA_current.owl">link to a visualization</a> created with WebVOWL.

## What is it good for?
The ontology is intended to provide the means for 
- creating an RDF-layer that could accompany every ‘traditional’ paper in literary studies, modelling the findings of this paper in a machine-readable way.
- theoretically: formulating findings in the field of literary studies directly in RDF.

## (Examples - temporarily omitted due to restructuring)


## What's next?
The ontology is a work in progress. Pending work includes:
- further alignment with relevant ontologies (CiTO for the classification of scholarly citation acts, FRBRoo for bibliographical data; CIDOC, DoCO etc.); 
- testing, refining and expanding the ontology in the course of one or more case studies
- looking into possible alignment with TEI-Standards
